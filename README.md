# Prime.java
Given two integers ‘L’ and ‘R’, write a program that finds the count of numbers having prime number of set bits in their binary 
representation in the range [L, R].

Input:
The first line consists of an integer T i.e number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case consists of two
integers L and R. 

Example:
Input:
2
6 10
10 15 

Output:
4
5


# K_thNO.java
Given a decimal number m. Convert it in binary string and apply n iterations, in each iteration 0 becomes 01 and 1 becomes 10. 
Find kth character in the string after nth iteration.

Input:
The first line consists of an integer T i.e number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case consists 
of three integers m,k,n. 

Example:
Input:
2
5 5 3
11 6 4

Output:
1
1
